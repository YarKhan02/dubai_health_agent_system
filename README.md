## Services Configuration

### Overview
The project uses a flexible service configuration system that allows easy management of medical services and packages.

### Configuration File
Services are defined in `config/services.json`, which contains:

### Service Management Features
The `services.py` module provides advanced methods to:
- List all service categories

- Find recommended services for specific groups

### Example Usage

categories = service_manager.get_categories()

# Search for cancer-related services
cancer_services = service_manager.search_services("cancer")

# Get services in a specific category
wellness_packages = service_manager.get_services_by_category("Wellness Packages")

# Find services recommended for women
women_services = service_manager.get_recommended_services("Women")

price = service_manager.get_service_price("Basic Health Check Up")
```

### Service Metadata
Each service includes:
- Unique ID
